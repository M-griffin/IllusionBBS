Install original v2.03 BBS Package, then overwrite your .EXE and .OVR files for the latest changes.
I did a lot of this over a decade ago so i can't help very much, but this is open and free to use or recode.

Source only is provided, i'll have to go through ANSIs and Menus, and the String file to see what
needs to be provided for a full working system is there is any interest in running or playing with this software.
